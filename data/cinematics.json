    "body": "0437 hours. Your phone vibrates itself off the nightstand. Unknown caller. A voice you’ve never heard speaks your name, the way a locksmith talks to a familiar lock. “Cadet, we don’t have time for a welcome packet.” A silent car waits outside. City sodium lights flash across your window like a heartbeat monitor gone wrong.\n\nIn the garage, the elevator doors close and the hum of the city fades. The brief is projected on brushed steel: an NGO’s small server farm is buckling under a gray spray of SSH failures; a finance clerk is being charmed by a stranger who knows her coffee order; a public web tier is miswired, bleeding trust into places it was never meant to flow. “This is a training op,” the voice says, “but the stakes are real. People get hurt when we are slow.”\n\nYou pass a wall of artifacts: a cracked drive sealed in evidence resin; an access badge with the photo scorched off; a signed key envelope, unopened. Beside them, a simple sticky note: ‘Protect the innocent. Leave every system better than you found it.’ You breathe. A calm you didn’t know you owned steps forward and takes the controls.\n\n“Here’s how we do this,” the voice continues. “We learn just enough to move, we move with discipline, and we write down what we changed so someone else can sleep tonight.”\n\nThe doors open into the Academy floor—quiet, focused, alive. Terminals blink. A mission board lists open tasks like constellations. Somewhere, an attacker believes the night is theirs. You tighten the strap on your bag. You’re not here to look clever. You’re here to be faithful, precise, and kind. The first light spills over the city. The breach arrives at dawn. So do you."
